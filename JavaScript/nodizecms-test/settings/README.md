You can copy "nodize.json" to "nodize.local.json" and set parameters that are local to the current computer.
If a "nodize.local.json" file exists, it will override parameters.

Database settings can also be defined in the "/themes/theme_name/settings/database.json", if this file does exists, the "/settings/database.json" is not used.
